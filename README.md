# About project

This project aims solving first- and second-degree equations.

# Details

You will have to show at least:

- The equation in its reduced form.
- The degree of the equation.
- Itâ€™s solution(s) and the polarity of the discriminant if it makes sens.

# How it works
Running the program
```
python3 computer.py
```
The program ask you to enter equation:
```
Enter equation: 5 * X^0 + 4 * X^1 - 9.3 * X^2 = 1 * X^0
```
Program result:
```
Reduced form: 4.0 * X^0 + 4.0 * X^1 - 9.3 * X^2 = 0
Polynomial degree: 2
Discriminant is strictly positive, the two solutions are:
-0.47513146680528123
0.9052389936870016
